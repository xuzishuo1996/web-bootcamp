  <p>My responsibilities</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Programmed on RISC-V MCU</strong> (with C): the MCU communicated with the master controller ARM
      through IPC channels and received instructions from the ARM. According to the type and stage of the
      neural network parsed form instructions, it allocated spaces for input and output images and configured
      parameters on the external DDR. To forward the neural network, it transferred offline instructions and
      inputs that were saved on the DDR to the hardware processing unit. Finally, it moved the results back to
      the DDR using the DMA approach. Implemented 4 types of networks.
    </li>
    <li>Wrote Linux shell scripts for testing and tested programs on the hardware platforms.</li>
    <li>Measured the execution time of networks with timers. Analyzed and improved the performance.</li>
